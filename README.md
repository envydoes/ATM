## Introduction

The **Automated Teller Machine (ATM)** program is a simple console-based application written in Java. It allows users to interact with the ATM and perform common banking operations:

1. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have a sufficient balance.

2. **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account, increasing their balance.

3. **Check Balance**: Users can check their account balance.

4. **Exit**: Users can exit the ATM program.

The program utilizes a `switch` statement to handle user choices and update the account balance accordingly. It runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## Prerequisites

To run this ATM simulation program, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- A Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a command-line environment to compile and run the Java program.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:


2. Open the project in your Java IDE or navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.

3. Compile and run the `ATM.java` file to start the ATM program.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform banking operations.

## Features

- **Withdraw**: Users can specify the amount they want to withdraw, and the program checks if they have a sufficient balance. If the balance is sufficient, the withdrawal is successful; otherwise, it displays an "Insufficient Balance" message.

- **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account by specifying the deposit amount. The program adds the deposit amount to the total balance.

- **Check Balance**: Users can check their account balance at any time.

- **Exit**: Users can exit the ATM program when they are done with their transactions.
